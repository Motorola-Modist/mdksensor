#MDK Sensor
The MDK Sensor application shows how to use the Raw interface with a unique sensor sending asynchronous data to the Moto X when using the Moto Mods Development Kit and the Sensor Personality Card.  More details can be found at <http://developer.motorola.com/build/examples/sensor>.

For this project to be functional, you will need to download the latest Moto Mods SDK.  See <http://developer.motorola.com/build/tools/setup-environment> for the library and instructions.
